// After the decimation, all world went into chaos. People had to rebuild the planet so Shield came up with a donation strategy. 
// They feel all the rich guys need to donate more than the poor guys. So, they make a rule. They would make a donation list in which
//  the donation of each person would be shown. But the rule is that a person canâ€™t pay less than what has already been paid before them. 
//  Find the extra amount each person will pay, and also, tell shield the total amount of donation.
